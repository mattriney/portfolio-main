# MyPortfolio

This is my portfolio. I built it to showcase skills, projects, and interests, etc. I intend for it to be under a constant state of change as my skills change.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
